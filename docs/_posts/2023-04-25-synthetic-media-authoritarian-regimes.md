title: "Scalable Synthetic Media: Authoritarian Regimes and the Erosion of Truth"
date: 2023-04-25

**Introduction**

Generative AI empowers authoritarian regimes to manipulate truth, creating a "synthetic reality" with AI-generated text, speech, images, and videos. This scalability amplifies the potential for political subversion and power abuse.

**Domestic Manipulation**

- Personalized propaganda crafted using synthetic content tailored to individual citizens
  - *Example*: An authoritarian regime employs AI algorithms to analyze citizens' social media profiles and generate customized content that reinforces the regime's narratives and values.
- AI-generated images, videos, and stories evoke fear, hatred, and division
  - *Example*: A regime spreads synthetic videos of staged violence, falsely attributed to a minority group, in order to stir up ethnic tensions and justify a crackdown on dissent.
- Drowning out dissenting voices and suppressing political opposition
  - *Example*: AI-generated social media accounts post and amplify propaganda, creating an "echo chamber" effect that drowns out legitimate dissenting voices and makes it difficult for political opposition to gain traction.

**International Influence**

- Synthetic content enables "perception hacks" on other countries
  - *Example*: An authoritarian regime uses AI-generated deepfake videos to fabricate a scandal involving a foreign leader, causing political instability in the targeted country.
- Disseminating propaganda and politically biased information through social media platforms
  - *Example*: Synthetic social media accounts spread disinformation about a contentious election in a foreign country, creating doubt about the legitimacy of the democratic process.
- Amplifying divisive messages and conspiracy theories
  - *Example*: AI-generated text and images promote conspiracy theories about public health crises, undermining trust in foreign government institutions.
- Manipulating foreign publics and governments, potentially swaying global politics in favor of authoritarian states
  - *Example*: A coordinated campaign of synthetic media distorts the international perception of a conflict between an authoritarian regime and a democratic nation, garnering support for the regime's actions.

**Democracy at Risk**

- Generative AI's asymmetric power subverts truth
  - *Example*: AI-generated disinformation erodes public trust in news outlets, causing citizens to question the validity of factual reporting.
- Risks to privacy, trustworthiness of information, and open societies
  - *Example*: AI-generated deepfakes target public figures, invading their privacy and manipulating public opinion against them.
- Democracies must develop robust methods for identifying and combating synthetic content at scale
  - *Example*: Governments invest in AI-driven tools and cross-agency collaborations to detect and respond to synthetic media threats.
- Further research on defensive techniques is vital as AI capabilities grow increasingly sophisticated and scalable
  - *Example*: International research partnerships are established to share knowledge, resources, and best practices for countering synthetic media and protecting democracies.
